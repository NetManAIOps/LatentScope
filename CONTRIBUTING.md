## Code Style
Please adhere to the Python PEP-8 programming style guidelines when writing code. This will ensure consistency and readability across the codebase. You can find more details about PEP-8 [here](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/).

## Writing Tests
It is important to write sufficient tests for any new code or changes to existing code. This helps in ensuring stability and reliability, preventing future regressions.

## Reporting Bugs
If you encounter any issues or bugs, please report them on the github issues page of the project. When filing a bug, include as much detail as possible. Descriptions of the issue, steps to reproduce, and any relevant configurations or screenshots are very helpful.

## Submitting Code
To submit your code to the project:
- Fork the repository - Start by forking the project repository to your GitHub account.
- Clone the repository - Clone the repository to your local machine to make your changes.
- Create a new branch - It's best to create a branch for each set of changes you make.
- Make your changes - Implement your feature or fix bugs, and make sure to write tests.
- Run the tests - Ensure all tests pass and your changes do not break existing functionality.
- Submit a Pull Request (PR) - Push your changes to your fork and then submit a pull request to the project's main branch. Provide a clear description of the changes and any other information that might be useful.
